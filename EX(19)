 Description : You are designing a poster which prints out numbers with a unique 
               style applied to each of them. The styling is based on the number of 
               closed paths or holes present in a giver number. The number of holes 
               that each of the digits from 0 to 9 have are equal to the number of closed 
               paths in the digit. Their values are:
               • 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 = 0 holes.
               • 0, 4, 6, and 9 = 1 hole.
               • 8 = 2 holes.
